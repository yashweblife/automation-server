# Automation Server
This is a full fledged express server that is meant to be used for home automation.
Im hosting it over a RaspberryPI 4.

### The project currently includes:
- A Todo List System
- A Chat System
- A Notification System

### The project wants to include
- A Light Control System
- A GPT-4 Interface
- A Home Storage System
- A Home Intelligence System
- A Camera Server
- A Robot Management System

# The premise

At some point, I want to make a self reliant server system.
We are over dependent on 3rd party servers and services, if we can learn to either make these services on our own or host premade ones on our side, we will be freed from these shackles.
